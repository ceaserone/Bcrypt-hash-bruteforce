# Bcrypt-Hash-Bruteforce
Python to decrypt bcrypt hashes!
----------------
Easy to use, pretty self explanatory and it works!

✓bcrypt_bruteforce.py

-usage: python bcrypt_bruteforce.py "hash"
(quick check, few simple passes in script.)

python bcrypt_bruteforce.py "hash" pwlist.txt 
(if only one hash use "")

python bcrypt_bruteforce.py hashlist.txt pwlist.txt
(pretty easy)

-Hash must be in " " is only one hash to prevent $ f'ups in terminal obviously.

-hash.txt hash's does not have to be " ", just when using one hash.

----------------
✓extract.users.json.hash.py

Usage: python extract.users.json.hash.py
(make sure users.json is in same dir) 

-This extracts hash's feom file.json
eg: users.json, will extract all to hashs.txt
-Make sure if you have a .txt rename to .json
